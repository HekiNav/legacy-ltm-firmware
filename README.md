# Old live train map firmware & server 
Still supported, but only for [Helsinki LTM](https://github.com/HekiNav/helsinki-live-train-map). The new firmware is located at [HekiNav/ltm-firmware](https://github.com/HekiNav/ltm-firmware)

## Firmware

The ESP32-C3 firmware is responsible for:

1. Connecting to Wi-Fi
2. Fetching live train data from the API
3. Processing data to determine train locations
4. Controlling WS2812B LED chains to display train positions
5. Handling button inputs and status LEDs
6. Hosting a web page for configuration

---

## Getting Started

1. **Flash the Firmware:**
   - Use the [Web Installer](#web-installer) (recommended, no drivers needed)
   - Or flash manually using PlatformIO (`Firmware/` directory)
2. **Connect to Wi-Fi:**
   - On first boot, use the web installer interface to configure Wi-Fi credentials. They are saved locally on the device.
3. **Power the Board:**
   - Use a 5V USB-C power supply capable of at least ~1A (~2A recommended for compatibility with higher brightness settings).
4. **Configure in the :**
   - Visit the IP address of your device (shown in Web Installer)
   - Configure options like tails, brightness and mode 
5. **Enjoy the Live Train Map!**

### Status LEDs

The top (🔌) power led is hardwired to the power rail

The middle and bottom status leds are controlled by the MCU

| LED | Light | Meaning |
|-----|-------|---------|
| top (🔌)    |🟩 green | The board is powered
| top (🔌)    |⬛ none  | The board is not powered
| top (🔌)    |🟥 red   | This shouldn't happen although it's techically possible if there's severe issues in the pcb
|||
| middle (ᯤ)  |🟩 green            | Connected to the API
| middle (ᯤ)  |🟩 green \(blinking\) | Mode change pending
| middle (ᯤ)  |⬛ none             | Connecting to the API
| middle (ᯤ)  |🟥 red              | Failed to connect to API
|||
| bottom (🌐)  |🟩 green \(blinking\) | Connecting to wifi
| bottom (🌐)  |🟩 green            | Connected to wifi
| bottom (🌐)  |⬛ none             | Failed to boot
| bottom (🌐)  |🟥 red              | Failed to connect to wifi

### Map Modes

There are 4(+1) map modes on the device. You can switch the mode by pressing the map (🗺️) button or by going to the control panel.

#### Lines (default)
- Shows commuter trains by line
- Only commuter trains
